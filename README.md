hi
Let's learn some git

A New Start
Git is a very powerful tool.


Hello Everyone .. i will hack all your laptops :p 

1- open the file
2- change something
3- git add (file name)
4- git commit -m "what did you change"
5- git push (if not pushed then do the following ):-
5/a- git fetch 
6/b- git rebase origin/master
7/c- git push

this is what i have already changed.. it is really getting hard and complicated
Let's learn some git, and a bit of vi as well and try it out!
